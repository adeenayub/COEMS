As metioned before this project is basically a website that enables
users to cast vote from any polling station in Pakistan securely 
and easily. The website is designed using Java based Spring Framework 
the follows the MVC pattern.For thumbprint recognition, the device used 
is Secugen Hamster Pro 20 which is connected to the laptop via USB cable.
The following explains how the main functionality works.
Accessing the website on cloud or locally opens the home page. The   
keyword 'index' gets selected in the URL. In return, the request mapping for 
'index' is looked for in the controller. In the controller, the related 
function public String First() gets called that returns the string 'home'.
Ultimately the home page gets returned. 
The voter chooses the option of 'cast vote' from the home page. The request 
goes from view to the controller where the function corresponding to the request
mapping 'castvote' gets called. The call returns the 'verifyvoter.jsp' page. 
The voter is prompted to enter his/her CNIC. Once the CNIC is entered, the 
entered field passes from the view to the controller where the function of 
service class gets called. This further calls the function of DAO class that 
checks against the database if the entered CNIC is correct. If a match is found,
the flag is decrypted. If the value of the flag is 0, then the voter is allowed 
to move to the 2nd step of verification. If it is 1, then the voter is not allowed
to go any further. 
The next step is Biometric verification for which a thumb print scanner is used. 
The voter is asked to give his/her thumb impression which gets matched with the ones
stored in the database. The algorithm used for thumb impression is the one employed by 
Secugen. Once the thumb print gets verified, the voter is allowed to move to the next page. 
Now the voter is asked to vote for both the national and provisional candiates. Whatever
option he/she chooses to vote first, the request goes from view to the controller where
the funtion of service class gets called. The service class calls the fucntions of the DAO
class that retrieves the respective candidates from the database. The voter now casts a vote 
for both the candidates. The flag in the voter's table is updated.
