# Cloud Based Online Election Management System(COEMS)
Due to lack of proper administration, several polling stations in Pakistan have
witnessed meagre security resulting in a string of rigging attempts, including people
trying to cast multiple votes. Moreover, the lack of opportunity to cast votes from another
city has led to a dire need of an amended system.
Cloud-based e-voting system is a website designed to provide all registered voters
a secure and convenient means of voting from any polling station in Pakistan. It makes
sure that rigging does not takes place and that multiple votes arenâ€™t casted by one person.
The procedure employed by our system is follows. The voter walks into any polling
station in Pakistan. Assuming their data is already entered and that they have been
registered, they are prompted to enter their CNIC. Once the CNIC is entered, the system
checks if the voter has already casted the vote. If they have, they are not allowed to
proceed further. If not, they are asked to verify themselves via thumb impressions after
which they may be allowed to vote for both the National and the Provincial Assembly.
The voter is presented with the candidates of their constituency. Once they select their
candidate of choice, their vote gets saved in the database. As soon as Election Day is over,
all the regions send in their data to another server using SSL which displays the result.
Hence, the Cloud-based e-voting system caters to the problems mentioned earlier.
