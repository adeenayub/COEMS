# Cloud Based Online Election Management System(COEMS)
Electoral processes have been riddled with controversy, more often than not. The 
United States presidential election, 2000(remember the Florida reccount?) is 
just one case in point. Keeping up with the seemingly global tradition, the Pakistan 
general election, 2013, was subject to rigging accusations and recount demands.
It's more than evident now: we need a revised electoral system, one that is equitable 
and secure.
Due to lack of proper administration, several polling stations in Pakistan have
witnessed meagre security resulting in a string of rigging attempts, including people
trying to cast multiple votes. Moreover, the lack of opportunity to cast votes from another
city has led to a dire need of an amended system.
Cloud-based e-voting system is a website designed to provide all registered voters
a secure and convenient means of voting from any polling station in Pakistan. It makes
sure that rigging does not takes place and that multiple votes arenâ€™t casted by one person.
The procedure employed by our system is follows. The voter walks into any polling
station in Pakistan. Assuming their data is already entered and that they have been
registered, they are prompted to enter their Computerized National Identity Card(CNIC) 
number. Once the CNIC is entered, the system checks if the voter has already casted 
the vote. If they have, they are not allowed to proceed further. If not, they are 
asked to verify themselves via thumb impressions after which they may be allowed 
to vote for both the National and the Provincial Assembly. The voter is presented 
with the candidates of their constituency. Once they select their candidate of 
choice, their vote gets saved in the database. As soon as Election Day is over,
all the regions send in their data to another server using SSL which displays the result.
Hence, the Cloud-based e-voting system caters to the problems mentioned earlier.
